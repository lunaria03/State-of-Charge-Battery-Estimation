# State-of-Charge-Battery-Estimation
This project aims to estimate the State of Charge (SOC) of a battery using two machine learning models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Support Vector Regression (SVR).

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various parameters related to battery performance, such as voltage, current, and temperature. The dataset was sourced from [Samsung INR21700 30T Li-Ion Battery Data - Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/9xyvy2njj3/1)
